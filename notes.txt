generate entities:
	look through the image for the specified RG values, set the value of blue to whatever blue it is
	if there are other pixels throughout the image which have the same blue value except + 1 and the R and G values are 0 of that pixel, add it to the path list for the character
	switch over the R value, use the enemy ID values to decide which one to spawn
